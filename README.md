## Problem Statement

Accurate prediction of house prices is crucial in real estate decision-making. The goal of this project is to build a data-driven regression model that forecasts house prices based on multiple property features.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- Google Colab

## Dataset

- Source: [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset)
- Filename: `dataset.csv`
- Features include lot size, year built, location, area, rooms, etc.

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical data
   - Normalize features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation matrix
   - Distribution plots
   - Outlier handling

3. **Modeling**
   - **Random Forest Regressor**
   - **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**
   - Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
   - Cross-validation

4. **Evaluation**
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R² Score
